[b]Starbase[/b]
It improves all the starbases, they are a little more resistant than the original base and are updated according to their technology, although you must be "more skilled" with your business decisions since these stations require more dedication and resources.

[b]Defensive Platforms[/b]
In addition, defense platforms are enhanced with additional slots of weapons, shields and logistics â€¦ once again, it will depend on you to maintain them and turn them into true defenses of your empire, which will give you more confidence by leaving them alone.

[b]Beware!â€¦[/b][list]
[*]Also your enemy could have fortified its borders with these stations.
[*]This does not guarantee that your bases are indestructible in a "Deadly Attack", but you will lose the battle with more dignity and cause more damage to the enemy.
